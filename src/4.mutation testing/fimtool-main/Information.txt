%% Details

## FAULT INJECTION 

%% Function details ---> FISingle(Configuration file, Output Directory) or FIMulti(Configuration file, Output Directory)
Configuration file: Stores the details of the fault model, model constants and thresholds, the fault suite and the list of faults to be injected
Output directory: where information of the results (information of mutants) will be stored

## FAULT CONFIGURATION

%% Function details ---> FCSingle(Configuration file, Output Directory, Fault_enable_list) or FCMulti(Configuration file, Output Directory, Fault_enable_list)
Configuration file: same as above
Output directory: same as above
Fault_list : contains a list of faults which need to be enabled during a simulation.

%% Sample run for SINGLE-MODEL case

## FAULT INJECTION 

To run the FIM tool for AECS Model, enter the following in the command prompt: >> FISingle('FIMConfigur_sfaircraft.txt','Results')

Note: After fault injection, the details of injected faults are stored in the specified folder, you can see the list of all faults! 

## FAULT CONFIGURATION

Navigate through the results to activate the fault blocks.

Make a list of all the faulty blocks that you want to turn on during a simulation run. A sample list is saved in the file 'FaultlistAircraft.xlsx' 
Select the fault numbers to enable them and specify the fault parameters. 

For AECS Model, in the command prompt, enter the following: >> FCSingle('FIMConfigur_sfaircraft.txt','Results','Faultlist_Aircraft.xlsx')


%% for MULTI-MODEL case, use the following commands-
Fault Injection: FIMulti('FIMConfigur_sfaircraft.txt','Results')
Fault Configuration: FCMulti('FIMConfigur_sfaircraft.txt','Results','Faultlist_Aircraft.xlsx')
